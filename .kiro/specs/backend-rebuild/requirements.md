# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project involves completely rebuilding the Strapi backend for the Viktoria Wertheim football club website while preserving the existing Next.js frontend. The current backend has persistent admin panel issues that cannot be resolved, necessitating a fresh installation. The database will also be rebuilt from scratch to eliminate corrupted data entries.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to completely remove the existing Strapi backend installation, so that I can start with a clean slate without any configuration conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend cleanup is initiated THEN the system SHALL remove all Strapi-related files and directories from viktoria-wertheim-backend
2. WHEN the database cleanup is performed THEN the system SHALL delete all existing database files and reset the database state
3. WHEN the cleanup is complete THEN the system SHALL preserve only essential configuration files that don't contain corrupted settings

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to install a fresh Strapi 5+ backend, so that I have a working admin panel without the previous issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Strapi is installed THEN the system SHALL use Strapi version 5.18.0 or later
2. WHEN the installation is complete THEN the system SHALL create a functional admin panel accessible at localhost:1337/admin
3. WHEN the backend starts THEN the system SHALL use SQLite for development as specified in the tech stack
4. WHEN the installation is verified THEN the system SHALL allow admin user creation and login

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to recreate all necessary content types, so that the frontend API calls continue to work without modification.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content types are created THEN the system SHALL include all content types required by the frontend (News, Teams/Mannschaften, Players/Spieler, Matches/Spiele, Sponsors)
2. WHEN content types are configured THEN the system SHALL maintain the same field names and data structures expected by the frontend
3. WHEN API endpoints are tested THEN the system SHALL return data in the same format as the previous backend
4. WHEN content types are complete THEN the system SHALL support all CRUD operations needed by the frontend

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure CORS and API permissions, so that the frontend can communicate with the new backend without issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CORS is configured THEN the system SHALL allow requests from the frontend development server (localhost:3000)
2. WHEN CORS is configured THEN the system SHALL allow requests from the production frontend domain
3. WHEN API permissions are set THEN the system SHALL allow public read access to all content types needed by the frontend
4. WHEN permissions are tested THEN the system SHALL respond successfully to all frontend API calls

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to seed the new database with clean test data, so that the frontend displays properly during development and testing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN test data is seeded THEN the system SHALL create sample entries for all content types
2. WHEN test data is created THEN the system SHALL use realistic German football club data appropriate for Viktoria Wertheim
3. WHEN seeding is complete THEN the system SHALL have enough data to test all frontend components
4. WHEN data is verified THEN the system SHALL ensure all relationships between content types work correctly

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify frontend-backend integration, so that I can confirm the rebuild was successful without breaking existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integration testing is performed THEN the system SHALL successfully serve all API endpoints called by the frontend
2. WHEN the frontend is tested THEN the system SHALL display data correctly in all components
3. WHEN API responses are verified THEN the system SHALL return data in the expected format and structure
4. WHEN the integration is complete THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing frontend functionality without code changes
