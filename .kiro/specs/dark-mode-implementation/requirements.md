# Dark Mode Implementation - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a dark mode feature for the SV Viktoria Wertheim website. The dark mode will provide users with an alternative color scheme that is easier on the eyes in low-light conditions while maintaining the same functionality and user experience as the light mode.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to toggle between light and dark mode, so that I can choose the visual theme that is most comfortable for my viewing conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the website THEN the system SHALL display the website in light mode by default
2. WHEN a user clicks the dark mode toggle button THEN the system SHALL switch the entire website to dark mode
3. WHEN a user clicks the toggle button again THEN the system SHALL switch back to light mode
4. WHEN a user refreshes the page THEN the system SHALL remember their previous theme preference

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want the dark mode toggle to be easily accessible, so that I can quickly switch themes without searching for the option.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the homepage THEN the system SHALL display a dark mode toggle button below the news ticker
2. WHEN a user hovers over the toggle button THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback indicating it's interactive
3. WHEN a user is on any page THEN the system SHALL maintain the same toggle button accessibility across all pages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want the dark mode to use appropriate colors that maintain readability, so that I can easily read all content in dark mode.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dark mode is active THEN the system SHALL use #000814 as the primary dark color
2. WHEN dark mode is active THEN the system SHALL maintain sufficient contrast ratios for text readability
3. WHEN dark mode is active THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing functionality without any behavioral changes
4. WHEN dark mode is active THEN the system SHALL only change colors and not modify layouts, spacing, or component structures

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want the dark mode to be consistent across all pages, so that my viewing experience is uniform throughout the website.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dark mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL apply dark theme to all pages (Home, News, Teams, Shop, Contact)
2. WHEN dark mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL apply dark theme to all components (Header, Footer, Cards, Forms, etc.)
3. WHEN a user navigates between pages THEN the system SHALL maintain the selected theme preference
4. WHEN dark mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL ensure all interactive elements remain clearly visible and functional

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want my theme preference to persist across browser sessions, so that I don't have to re-select my preferred theme every time I visit the website.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects dark mode THEN the system SHALL store this preference in localStorage
2. WHEN a user returns to the website THEN the system SHALL automatically apply their previously selected theme
3. WHEN a user clears their browser data THEN the system SHALL revert to the default light mode
4. WHEN a user visits from a different device THEN the system SHALL use the default light mode until they make a selection
