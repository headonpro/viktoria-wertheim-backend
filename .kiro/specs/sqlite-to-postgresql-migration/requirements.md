# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for migrating the Viktoria Wertheim backend application from SQLite to PostgreSQL database. The migration is necessary to support self-hosted production deployment on a single Linux server where PostgreSQL, Strapi backend, and Next.js frontend will all run together. The migration must preserve all existing data while ensuring optimal performance for a single-server setup and maintaining application functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to migrate from SQLite to PostgreSQL, so that the application can handle production workloads with better performance and concurrent access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL use PostgreSQL as the primary database
2. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL connect to PostgreSQL instead of SQLite
3. WHEN database operations are performed THEN the system SHALL maintain the same performance or better compared to SQLite
4. WHEN multiple users access the system concurrently THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent database connections properly

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a content manager, I want all existing data to be preserved during migration, so that no content or configuration is lost.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is executed THEN the system SHALL transfer all existing data from SQLite to PostgreSQL
2. WHEN data is migrated THEN the system SHALL preserve all relationships between content types
3. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL verify data integrity and completeness
4. WHEN content is accessed after migration THEN the system SHALL display the same content as before migration
5. WHEN user accounts are accessed THEN the system SHALL maintain all user permissions and authentication data

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the database configuration to be environment-specific, so that development, staging, and production can use appropriate database setups.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs in development THEN the system SHALL support both SQLite and PostgreSQL configurations
2. WHEN environment variables are set THEN the system SHALL automatically connect to the specified PostgreSQL instance
3. WHEN no PostgreSQL configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL fall back to SQLite for local development
4. WHEN database credentials are configured THEN the system SHALL securely handle connection strings and authentication

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the migration process to be automated and repeatable, so that it can be executed consistently across different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration script is executed THEN the system SHALL automatically create the PostgreSQL database schema
2. WHEN the migration runs THEN the system SHALL provide clear progress indicators and logging
3. WHEN migration fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error messages and rollback capabilities
4. WHEN the migration is re-executed THEN the system SHALL handle idempotent operations without data duplication
5. WHEN the migration completes THEN the system SHALL generate a migration report with statistics

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper backup and recovery procedures, so that data can be restored if issues occur during migration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migration begins THEN the system SHALL create a backup of the existing SQLite database
2. WHEN PostgreSQL is configured THEN the system SHALL support standard PostgreSQL backup procedures
3. WHEN data corruption is detected THEN the system SHALL provide rollback mechanisms to restore from backup
4. WHEN backup is created THEN the system SHALL verify backup integrity before proceeding with migration

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the PostgreSQL setup optimized for single-server deployment, so that all components (database, backend, frontend) run efficiently on one Linux server.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN PostgreSQL is installed THEN the system SHALL be configured for local connections without external network exposure
2. WHEN the server starts THEN the system SHALL automatically start PostgreSQL service before Strapi backend
3. WHEN resources are allocated THEN the system SHALL optimize PostgreSQL memory usage for shared server resources
4. WHEN connections are established THEN the system SHALL use Unix domain sockets for local database connections when possible
5. WHEN backup is performed THEN the system SHALL store backups locally on the same server with proper file permissions

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all mock data removed from the frontend components before migration, so that only real database data is used and migrated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN frontend components load THEN the system SHALL only display data from the Strapi API or show appropriate empty states
2. WHEN API data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display proper loading states or "no data available" messages instead of mock data
3. WHEN the migration begins THEN the system SHALL ensure no mock data is present in frontend components that could interfere with real data validation
4. WHEN components are tested THEN the system SHALL verify that all mock data fallbacks have been removed
5. WHEN real data is seeded THEN the system SHALL use only legitimate seeding scripts for actual league and content data

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want updated documentation and configuration examples, so that team members can set up PostgreSQL environments correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL provide updated environment configuration examples
2. WHEN developers set up local environments THEN the system SHALL include PostgreSQL setup instructions
3. WHEN deployment occurs THEN the system SHALL provide Linux server PostgreSQL installation and configuration guidelines
4. WHEN troubleshooting is needed THEN the system SHALL include common PostgreSQL issues and solutions for self-hosted setups
