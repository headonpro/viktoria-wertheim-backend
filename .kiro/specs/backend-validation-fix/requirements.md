# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Viktoria Wertheim project is nearly complete and ready for content population, but there's a critical validation issue preventing team (Mannschaft) creation through the Strapi admin interface. While the API works correctly via scripts, the admin interface throws "Validation error: Invalid status" warnings, blocking content editors from managing teams through the CMS. This issue must be resolved to enable proper content management workflow.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a content administrator, I want to create and manage teams through the Strapi admin interface, so that I can populate the website with team data without requiring technical scripts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the Mannschaft content type in Strapi admin THEN the interface SHALL load without validation errors
2. WHEN I create a new Mannschaft entry with valid data THEN the system SHALL save the entry successfully
3. WHEN I edit an existing Mannschaft entry THEN the system SHALL update the entry without validation conflicts
4. WHEN I set the status field for a Mannschaft THEN the system SHALL accept all valid status values defined in the schema

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify the root cause of the validation discrepancy between API and admin interface, so that I can implement a permanent fix.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I analyze the Mannschaft schema definition THEN I SHALL identify any enum or validation mismatches
2. WHEN I compare API validation vs admin validation THEN I SHALL document the specific differences
3. WHEN I examine the database schema THEN I SHALL verify field constraints match the content type definition
4. WHEN I review recent migrations or changes THEN I SHALL identify what caused the validation divergence

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive validation testing for all content types, so that I can ensure the entire CMS functions correctly for content editors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I test each content type creation through admin interface THEN all SHALL work without validation errors
2. WHEN I test content type updates through admin interface THEN all changes SHALL save successfully
3. WHEN I compare admin interface behavior with API behavior THEN both SHALL produce consistent results
4. WHEN I validate enum fields across all content types THEN all SHALL accept their defined values correctly

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a content editor, I want clear error messages and field validation feedback, so that I can understand and correct any data entry issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validation fails for any field THEN the system SHALL display specific, actionable error messages
2. WHEN I enter invalid data THEN the system SHALL highlight the problematic fields clearly
3. WHEN enum validation fails THEN the system SHALL show the list of valid options
4. WHEN I save content successfully THEN the system SHALL provide clear confirmation feedback

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a project stakeholder, I want documentation of the validation fix process, so that similar issues can be prevented and resolved quickly in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the validation issue is resolved THEN comprehensive documentation SHALL be created explaining the root cause
2. WHEN the fix is implemented THEN step-by-step resolution instructions SHALL be documented
3. WHEN testing is complete THEN validation test procedures SHALL be documented for future use
4. WHEN the project is deployed THEN preventive measures SHALL be documented to avoid similar issues
