# Frontend 404 Error Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

The frontend was calling several API endpoints that either didn't exist or had incorrect names. Here are the fixes applied:

### 1. Endpoint Issues Fixed

**Non-existent endpoints replaced**:
- `/api/tabellen-eintrag` → **Use `/api/teams`** (teams contain league table data)
- `/api/spielerstatistiks` → **Removed** (endpoint doesn't exist, use fallback data)

**Correct endpoint names confirmed**:
- `/api/news-artikels` ✅ (plural form is correct)
- `/api/game-cards` ✅ (plural form is correct)  
- `/api/next-game-cards` ✅ (plural form is correct)

### 2. Files Updated

#### Frontend Services:
- **`frontend/src/services/leagueService.ts`**:
  - Replaced all `tabellen-eintrag` calls with `/api/teams` endpoint
  - Teams endpoint contains all league table data (tabellenplatz, punkte, etc.)
  
- **`frontend/src/services/teamService.ts`**:
  - Confirmed `game-cards` and `next-game-cards` use correct plural forms

#### Frontend Components:
- **`frontend/src/components/NewsTicker.tsx`**:
  - Confirmed `/news-artikels` is correct (plural form)
  
- **`frontend/src/app/page.tsx`**:
  - Confirmed `/news-artikels` is correct (plural form)
  - Removed non-existent `/spielerstatistiks` API call
  
- **`frontend/src/app/news/page.tsx`**:
  - Confirmed `/news-artikels` is correct (plural form)
  
- **`frontend/src/app/news/[id]/page.tsx`**:
  - Confirmed `/news-artikels` is correct (plural form)

- **`frontend/src/components/TopScorers.tsx`**:
  - Removed non-existent `/spielerstatistiks` API call
  - Now uses fallback data directly since the endpoint was removed in backend simplification

#### Backend Documentation:
- **`backend/API_REFERENCE_FOR_FRONTEND.md`**:
  - Updated all endpoint references to use correct forms
  - Updated collection type table with actual available endpoints

### 3. Removed Non-Existent API Calls

The following API endpoints were removed from the backend during simplification but the frontend was still trying to call them:

- **`/api/spielerstatistiks`**: This endpoint was removed. Components now use fallback data.

### 4. Root Cause

The 404 errors were caused by:
1. **Non-existent Endpoints**: Frontend was calling `/api/tabellen-eintrag` and `/api/spielerstatistiks` which don't exist
2. **Incorrect Assumptions**: Assumed singular forms when Strapi actually uses plural forms for some endpoints
3. **Backend Simplification**: Some endpoints were removed but frontend still tried to call them

### 5. Expected Results

After these fixes:
- ✅ League table data should load correctly from `/api/teams` (contains all league table info)
- ✅ News articles should load correctly from `/api/news-artikels`
- ✅ Game cards should load correctly from `/api/game-cards` and `/api/next-game-cards`
- ✅ TopScorers component will show fallback data instead of throwing 404 errors
- ✅ Homepage will load news without trying to fetch non-existent player statistics

### 6. Testing Recommendations

To verify the fixes:
1. Start the backend: `cd backend && npm run develop`
2. Start the frontend: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
3. Check browser console for any remaining 404 errors
4. Verify that components load data correctly:
   - League tables show team standings
   - News articles display properly
   - TopScorers shows player data (fallback)
   - Game cards show match information

### 7. Future Considerations

If player statistics functionality is needed in the future:
1. Create a new `spieler-statistik` content type in Strapi
2. Update the TopScorers component to call the new endpoint
3. Update the homepage to fetch real player data instead of using empty arrays

All endpoint calls now use the actual available endpoints that exist in the backend. The league table functionality now uses the teams endpoint which contains all the necessary data.
