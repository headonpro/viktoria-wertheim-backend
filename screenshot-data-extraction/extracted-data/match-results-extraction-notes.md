## Manual Extraction Process for Match Results

### Step 1: Identify Match Results Sections
For each screenshot:
1. Look for sections labeled "Ergebnisse", "Spiele", "Resultate", or similar
2. Find tables or lists showing completed matches
3. Identify matches involving SV Viktoria Wertheim
4. Note if results are from current season (2025/26) or previous seasons

### Step 2: Extract Match Data
For each completed match found:
1. **Date**: Extract match date (format may vary - convert to YYYY-MM-DD)
2. **Teams**: Extract home and away team names (exact spelling)
3. **Score**: Extract final score (home goals - away goals)
4. **League**: Note which league/competition
5. **Match Day**: Extract round/match day number if visible
6. **Status**: Should be "beendet" (finished) for completed matches
7. **Additional Info**: Note any extra details (venue, time, etc.)

### Step 3: Data Validation
1. Verify scores are reasonable (typically 0-10 goals per team)
2. Check that dates are in the past (completed matches)
3. Ensure team names match those in league table
4. Confirm league assignments are consistent
5. Validate that SV Viktoria Wertheim is involved in each match
