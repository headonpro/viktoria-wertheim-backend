## Manual Extraction Process

### Step 1: Screenshot Examination
For each screenshot:
1. Open the image file
2. Look for league table/standings sections
3. Identify if it shows SV Viktoria Wertheim's league
4. Note the league name and division
5. Check if full table is visible or partially cropped

### Step 2: Data Extraction
For each league table found:
1. Extract league name (e.g., "Kreisliga A WÃ¼rzburg")
2. Extract season (should be 2025/26)
3. For each team in the table, extract:
   - Position (1, 2, 3, etc.)
   - Team name (exact spelling)
   - Matches played
   - Wins
   - Draws
   - Losses
   - Goals for
   - Goals against
   - Goal difference
   - Points

### Step 3: Data Validation
1. Check that points calculation matches wins/draws (3 points per win, 1 per draw)
2. Verify goal difference = goals for - goals against
3. Ensure team positions are sequential
4. Cross-check data across multiple screenshots if available
