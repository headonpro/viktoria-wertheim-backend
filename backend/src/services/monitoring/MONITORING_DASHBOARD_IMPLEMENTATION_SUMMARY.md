- Event emission for rollout lifecycle events

**Rollout Templates:**
- **Canary Rollout**: 1% → 10% → 100% with validation at each phase
- **Blue-Green Deployment**: Instant 100% switch with rollback capability
- **Gradual Rollout**: 25% → 50% → 75% → 100% steady progression

### 6. Feature Flag Monitoring (FeatureFlagMonitoring.ts)

**Features Implemented:**
- Usage metrics tracking (evaluations, unique users, enabled/disabled percentages)
- Performance monitoring (evaluation times, percentiles)
- Alert system for performance and usage issues
- Trend analysis (evaluation, error, performance trends)
- Notification system (email, webhook, Slack support)
- Alert configuration per flag
- Monitoring summary and statistics
- Data retention and cleanup

**Monitored Metrics:**
- Evaluation counts and rates
- Performance percentiles (P95, P99)
- Error rates and counts
- Cache hit rates
- User segmentation
- Performance impact analysis

### 7. Dashboard Integration (DashboardIntegration.ts)

**Features Implemented:**
- Unified initialization and management of all dashboard components

- Configuration management
- Health checks for all components
- Statistics aggregation
- Graceful shutdown handling
- Strapi integration hooks

## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow
1. **Hook Execution** → Performance Monitor → Dashboard Metrics
2. **Errors** → Error Tracker → Dashboard Alerts
3. **Background Jobs** → Job Monitor → System Health
4. **Feature Flags** → Feature Flag Services → Dashboard Integration
5. **Real-time Updates** → WebSocket → Dashboard UI

### Performance Optimizations
- Response caching with configurable TTL
- Metrics history size limits
- Automatic data cleanup
- Rate limiting for API and WebSocket
- Efficient data structures for real-time updates

### Security Features
- CORS configuration
- Rate limiting
- Input validation
- Error handling without information leakage
- Optional authentication support

  metricsHistorySize: 100,
  enableRealTimeUpdates: true,
  performanceThresholds: {
    slowHookThreshold: 100,
    highErrorRateThreshold: 5,
    criticalErrorRateThreshold: 15
  }
}
```
