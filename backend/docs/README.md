## Migration from Legacy System

The refactored system provides significant improvements over the legacy implementation:

### Before (Legacy System)
- ‚ùå Monolithic hook implementations
- ‚ùå Blocking operations causing timeouts
- ‚ùå Complex interdependencies
- ‚ùå Limited error handling
- ‚ùå No performance monitoring
- ‚ùå Difficult to test and maintain

### After (Refactored System)
- ‚úÖ Modular service architecture
- ‚úÖ Non-blocking async operations
- ‚úÖ Clear service boundaries
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive error handling
- ‚úÖ Real-time monitoring
- ‚úÖ Fully testable components

## Support and Maintenance
