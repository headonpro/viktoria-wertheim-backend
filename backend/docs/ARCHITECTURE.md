# Lifecycle Hooks Architecture Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the refactored Strapi Lifecycle Hooks architecture that transforms the original monolithic, error-prone system into a modular, stable, and performant solution. The new architecture follows the principle of "graceful degradation" and separates critical from non-critical operations.

## Architecture Principles

### 1. Graceful Degradation
- System continues to function even when non-critical components fail
- Critical operations are protected and isolated
- Fallback mechanisms ensure basic functionality remains available

### 2. Modular Design
- Each hook service has a single, well-defined responsibility
- Services are loosely coupled and independently testable
- Clear separation between validation, calculation, and monitoring concerns

### 3. Performance First
- Synchronous operations are limited to essential tasks only
- Heavy calculations are moved to background processing
- Timeout protection prevents blocking operations

```

## Core Components

### 1. Hook Service Factory

**Location**: `backend/src/services/HookServiceFactory.ts`

The central factory responsible for creating and managing all hook services with unified error handling.

```typescript
interface HookServiceFactory {
  createTeamService(): TeamHookService
  createSaisonService(): SaisonHookService
  createTableService(): TableHookService
  getConfig(): HookConfiguration
}
```

**Key Features**:
- Dependency injection for configuration
- Service lifecycle management
- Unified error handling across all services

### 2. Base Hook Service

**Location**: `backend/src/services/BaseHookService.ts`

Abstract base class providing common functionality for all hook services.

```typescript
abstract class BaseHookService {
  protected config: HookConfiguration
  protected logger: Logger
  
  abstract beforeCreate(event: HookEvent): Promise<HookResult>
  abstract beforeUpdate(event: HookEvent): Promise<HookResult>
  abstract afterCreate(event: HookEvent): Promise<void>
  abstract afterUpdate(event: HookEvent): Promise<void>
  
  protected async executeWithTimeout<T>(
    operation: () => Promise<T>,
    timeoutMs: number
  ): Promise<T>
  
  protected handleError(error: Error, context: HookContext): HookResult
}
```

**Key Features**:
- Timeout protection for all operations
- Standardized error handling
- Performance monitoring integration
- Configuration management

### 3. Validation Service

**Location**: `backend/src/services/ValidationService.ts`

Modular validation system with configurable rule management.

```typescript
interface ValidationService {
  validateCritical(data: any, rules: ValidationRule[]): ValidationResult
  validateWarning(data: any, rules: ValidationRule[]): ValidationResult
  isValidationEnabled(ruleName: string): boolean
}
```

**Key Features**:
- Separation of critical vs warning validations
- Configurable validation rules
- Rule dependency resolution
- Localized error messages

### 4. Calculation Service

**Location**: `backend/src/services/CalculationService.ts`

Handles automatic field calculations with sync/async separation.

```typescript
interface CalculationService {
  calculateSync(data: any, calculations: SyncCalculation[]): CalculationResult
  scheduleAsync(data: any, calculations: AsyncCalculation[]): void
  getCalculationStatus(jobId: string): CalculationStatus
}
```

**Key Features**:
- Immediate synchronous calculations for critical fields
- Background processing for complex calculations
- Calculation dependency management
- Fallback values for failed calculations

## Data Flow Patterns

### Hook Execution Flow

1. **Request Received**: Strapi receives CRUD operation
2. **Hook Triggered**: Appropriate lifecycle hook is called
3. **Service Factory**: Creates or retrieves service instance
4. **Validation**: Critical and warning validations are executed
5. **Sync Calculations**: Immediate calculations are performed
6. **Async Scheduling**: Heavy calculations are queued for background processing
7. **Response**: Operation completes with appropriate result
8. **Background Processing**: Queued jobs are processed asynchronously

### Error Handling Flow

1. **Error Occurs**: Exception is thrown in hook operation
2. **Error Classification**: Error is categorized (critical/warning/info)
3. **Recovery Strategy**: Appropriate recovery mechanism is applied
4. **Fallback Execution**: Fallback values or operations are used
5. **Logging**: Error is logged with full context
6. **Monitoring**: Error metrics are updated
7. **Alerting**: Notifications are sent if thresholds are exceeded

## Integration Points
