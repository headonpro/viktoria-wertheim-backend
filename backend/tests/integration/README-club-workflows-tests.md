# Club Workflows Integration Tests

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive integration tests implemented for club workflows as part of task 12.2. These tests validate complete end-to-end workflows involving club operations, ensuring all requirements are properly tested at the integration level.

## Test Coverage

### 1. Complete Game Creation with Clubs

**Tests implemented:**
- `should create game with clubs and trigger table calculation`
- `should validate clubs are in same league before game creation`
- `should prevent clubs from playing against themselves`

**Coverage:**
- Game creation workflow with club relations
- Club validation before game creation
- Business rule enforcement (clubs can't play themselves)
- Integration between game creation and table calculation triggers

### 2. Table Calculation Testing with Club Data

**Tests implemented:**
- `should calculate club statistics correctly`
- `should create missing club table entries`

**Coverage:**
- Club-based statistics calculation
- Automatic table entry creation for clubs
- Integration between game data and table calculations
- Proper handling of club relations in table entries

### 3. Migration Workflows and Data Consistency

**Tests implemented:**
- `should migrate team-based games to club-based games`
- `should validate data consistency after migration`

**Coverage:**
- Team-to-club migration workflows
- Data consistency validation
- Mixed system handling (team and club data coexistence)
- Migration rollback scenarios
- Orphaned data detection

### 4. API Endpoint Testing for Club Operations

**Tests implemented:**
- `should handle club CRUD operations via API`
- `should handle club search and filtering via API`

**Coverage:**
- Complete CRUD operations for clubs
- API parameter validation
- Search and filtering functionality
- Response format consistency
- Error handling in API operations

### 5. Performance and Caching Integration

**Tests implemented:**
- `should handle caching in club operations`
- `should handle performance monitoring in table calculations`

**Coverage:**
- Cache hit/miss scenarios
- Cache invalidation workflows
- Performance monitoring integration
- Metrics collection and reporting

### 6. Error Handling and Recovery

**Tests implemented:**
- `should handle database transaction failures`
- `should handle partial data scenarios gracefully`
- `should handle concurrent operations safely`

**Coverage:**
- Database transaction failure recovery
- Partial data handling (missing relations)
- Concurrent operation safety
- Graceful degradation scenarios

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run all integration tests
npm test -- --testPathPattern=integration/club-workflows.test.ts

# Run specific test suite
npx jest tests/integration/club-workflows.test.ts --verbose

# Run with coverage
npx jest tests/integration/club-workflows.test.ts --coverage
```

## Test Results

All 14 integration tests pass successfully:

- ✅ Complete Game Creation with Clubs (3 tests)
- ✅ Table Calculation Testing with Club Data (2 tests)
- ✅ Migration Workflows and Data Consistency (2 tests)
- ✅ API Endpoint Testing for Club Operations (2 tests)
- ✅ Performance and Caching Integration (2 tests)
- ✅ Error Handling and Recovery (3 tests)

## Future Enhancements

### Additional Test Scenarios
- Load testing with large datasets
