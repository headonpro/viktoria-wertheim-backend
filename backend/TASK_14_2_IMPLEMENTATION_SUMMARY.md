# Task 14.2 Implementation Summary: Create Operational Tooling

## Overview
Successfully implemented comprehensive operational tooling for the club collection system, providing maintenance scripts, backup/restore procedures, diagnostic tools, and automated health checks. This tooling ensures system reliability, data integrity, and optimal performance through automated processes and detailed diagnostics.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Club Maintenance Manager (`scripts/club-maintenance.js`)
**Purpose**: Comprehensive maintenance tool for club data cleanup and system optimization

**Features**:
- **Orphaned Club Cleanup**: Identifies and removes clubs without liga relationships that aren't referenced in games or table entries
- **Duplicate Club Resolution**: Detects and resolves duplicate club names, keeping the club with the most relationships
- **Data Integrity Validation**: Comprehensive checks for data consistency and integrity issues
- **Old Data Cleanup**: Removes outdated calculation data and metadata based on retention policies
- **Database Optimization**: Performs ANALYZE and VACUUM operations, checks index usage
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generates detailed JSON reports with operation results and recommendations

**Key Operations**:
```javascript
// Cleanup orphaned clubs
await maintenance.cleanupOrphanedClubs();

// Remove duplicate club names
await maintenance.cleanupDuplicateClubs();

// Validate data integrity
await maintenance.validateClubDataIntegrity();

// Clean old calculation data
await maintenance.cleanupOldCalculationData();

// Optimize database performance
await maintenance.optimizeDatabase();
```

**CLI Usage**:
```bash
# Run all maintenance operations
npm run ops:maintenance

# Run specific operations
npm run ops:maintenance:orphaned    # Clean orphaned clubs
npm run ops:maintenance:duplicates  # Remove duplicates
npm run ops:maintenance:validate    # Validate data integrity
npm run ops:maintenance:cleanup     # Clean old data
npm run ops:maintenance:optimize    # Optimize database
```

### 2. Backup & Restore Manager (`scripts/club-backup-restore.js`)
**Purpose**: Complete backup and restore system for club data protection

**Features**:
- **Full System Backups**: Complete backup of all club-related data with compression and checksums
- **Incremental Backups**: Efficient backups of only changed data since last backup
- **Selective Restoration**: Restore specific tables or complete system from backups
- **Backup Verification**: SHA-256 checksums ensure backup integrity
- **Automated Cleanup**: Removes old backups based on retention policies
- **Metadata Management**: Detailed backup metadata with version tracking

**Backup Structure**:
```
backups/club-data/
├── club-full-backup-2024-01-15T10-30-00.json.gz      # Compressed backup data
├── club-full-backup-2024-01-15T10-30-00.metadata.json # Backup metadata
├── club-incremental-backup-2024-01-15T16-30-00.json.gz
└── club-incremental-backup-2024-01-15T16-30-00.metadata.json
```

**Key Operations**:
```javascript
// Create full backup
const backup = await backupManager.createFullBackup();

// Create incremental backup
const incremental = await backupManager.createIncrementalBackup();

// List available backups
const backups = await backupManager.listBackups();

// Restore from backup
await backupManager.restoreFromBackup('backup-name');

// Clean up old backups
await backupManager.cleanupOldBackups({ retentionDays: 30 });
```

**CLI Usage**:

## Integration with Existing Systems

### Monitoring Service Integration
All tools integrate seamlessly with the existing monitoring infrastructure:

```javascript
// Record operational metrics
const monitoringService = strapi.service('api::club.monitoring-service');
monitoringService.recordMetric('maintenance_operations', 1, {
  operation: 'cleanup_orphaned_clubs',
  status: 'success'
});

// Get system health status
const systemStatus = await monitoringService.getSystemStatus();
```

### Cache Manager Integration
Tools work with the cache manager for performance optimization:

```javascript
// Test cache operations
const cacheManager = strapi.service('api::club.cache-manager');
await cacheManager.set('test_key', 'test_value', 60);
const value = await cacheManager.get('test_key');
```

### Event System Integration
Tools emit and listen for system events:

```javascript
// Emit maintenance events
strapi.eventHub.emit('club.maintenance.completed', {
  operation: 'cleanup_orphaned_clubs',
  result: { cleaned: 5, checked: 20 }
});

// Listen for club operations
strapi.eventHub.on('club.created', (data) => {
  // Record metrics or trigger health checks
});
```

## Automation and Scheduling

### Cron Job Setup
Automated execution through system cron jobs:

```bash
# Daily maintenance at 2 AM
0 2 * * * cd /path/to/backend && npm run ops:maintenance

# Weekly full backup on Sundays at 3 AM
0 3 * * 0 cd /path/to/backend && npm run ops:backup:full

# Daily incremental backup at 6 AM
0 6 * * * cd /path/to/backend && npm run ops:backup:incremental

# Weekly diagnostics on Mondays at 4 AM
0 4 * * 1 cd /path/to/backend && npm run ops:diagnostics
```

### Systemd Service (Linux)
Continuous health monitoring service:

```ini
# /etc/systemd/system/club-health-check.service
[Unit]
Description=Club Health Check Service
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=www-data
WorkingDirectory=/path/to/backend
ExecStart=/usr/bin/node scripts/club-health-check.js start
Restart=always
RestartSec=10
Environment=NODE_ENV=production

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

## Logging and Reporting

### Structured Logging
All tools generate structured logs in JSON format:

```
